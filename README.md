# PS2 ECC <-> Bin Memory Card Converter

A little bit modernized version of my old simple tool that coverts PS2 memory card images between ECC and non ECC binary formats. Might be useful for converting images created by Memory Card Annihilator to format used by PCSX2 and vice versa.

```
Use: convmcecc [options] inputFile outputFile

Options:
    -2e     convert file into ECC format
    -2b     convert file into bin format
    -h      show this info
```
